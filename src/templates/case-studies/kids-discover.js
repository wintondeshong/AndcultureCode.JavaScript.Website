                                <p>Once business needs were defined, we kicked off a second phase of research in 10 schools throughout the Northeastern U.S. Through observations and interviews, we learned how supplemental content is applied in the classroom and how students and teachers used and interacted with technology. With all of these findings, we were able to make informed product recommendations and start to write rules (e.g., “must make reading an active process”).</p>

The way teachers secured technology resources — both devices and software — varied greatly by school, but, clearly, teachers were the drivers. We needed to figure out how to target teachers individually and support them in sourcing and paying for our product, in order to drive adoption. Additionally, we needed to support a growing homeschooling population. We had to confirm that a student-centric version made sense to address both teachers and homeschoolers, in terms of user acquisition, value proposition and pricing.</p>

In order to design a product that stayed true to Kids Discover print experience, we converted each magazine into a “unit” and each magazine spread into a “topic.” Using a custom (and super intuitive, of course) content management system, Kids Discover is able to create pages using its print content and assets. The back-end is configured to allow for three Lexile® levels for each content block, in an effort to meet kids where they are.</p>
